## Purpose

The purpose of this study was to determine whether Natural Language Processing can be used to identify theoretical constructs associated with health behaviors accurately.

## Theoretical Framework

The Health Action Process Approach (HAPA) suggests that the adoption, initiation, and maintenance of health behaviors must be explicitly conceived as a process that consists of at least a motivation phase and a volition phase (Schwarzer et al., 2014). Key constructs of the motivational phase include risk perceptions (i.e., perceived chances of an adverse health outcome) and positive outcome expectancies (i.e., positive health benefits), while one key construct of the volitional phase includes coping planning (i.e., a plan developed to cope with a challenging situation). 

## Participants

Participants were recruited via members of the [Mississippi Partnership for Comprehensive Control Control](https://msdh.ms.gov/msdhsite/index.cfm/43,0,292,426,html) Consortia. Eligibility included being diagnosed with a chronic health condition (e.g., cancer, diabetes, or cardiovascular disease).

## Data

A Qualtrics survey was developed to educate community members on the health benefits of diet and exercise as well as provide them with an opportunity to respond to questions in an open-ended format. The questions that gauged (1) their risk perceptions if they don't improve their health behaviors, (2) potential benefits associated with a healthy lifestyle, and (3) a plan developed to cope with a challenging situation that interferes with being active or consuming a healthy meal. The data were coded to reflect each specific construct.  In total, there were over 1000 comments. Rows with missing comments were deleted, and irrelevant comments were removed.
